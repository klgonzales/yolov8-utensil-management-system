# Automated Utensil Management System for Enhanced Dining Experience in Busy Restaurants

In bustling restaurant environments, the manual monitoring and restocking of utensils (spoons, forks, and knives) on dining tables pose significant challenges, leading to potential errors and operational inefficiencies. To address this issue, an innovative solution involves implementing a YOLOv8-based Object Detection System, revolutionizing the way utensils are managed in busy restaurant settings.

## Features:
1. **Start Utensil Detection**
   - Press the "START UTENSIL DETECTION ðŸ”Ž" button to initiate the automated detection and tracking of utensils.

2. **Record Video**
   - Press the "RECORD ðŸ”´" button to start recording video. Press again to stop recording.
   - Recorded videos will be saved in the `Recorded-Video` folder within the project directory.

## Prerequisite:

Install dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install sv-ttk
```

## Instructions:
1. Run the application by running the `app.py` file.
